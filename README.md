# Co-Working Read Me

Welcome to my co-working space web-based application, the following information may be helpful for starting and running the server and client locally.

## Setting up the node server

The server is located in the folder called server, open this file location in your terminal (this can be done easiest by opening a new terminal, typing 'cd ' and then dragging the server folder into the terminal, which will generate the file location. Press enter and you will be taken into the server folder.

First run 'npm i' or 'npm install' to run install the required packages for the server to run. Once that is complete run 'npm start' to begin running the terminal.

In short:

1.  Go into the server folder in terminal
2.  Run npm i
3.  Run npm start
4.  done

## Setting up the client

The client is located in the folder called client-app, follow the same steps as were done for the server:

1.  Go into the client-app folder in terminal
2.  Run npm i
3.  Run npm start (this may take around a minute as react has to setup)
4.  React should open the browser page automatically, if not you can go to 'http://localhost3000/'

I hope you enjoy the web application, and I recommend reader the documentation to familiarise and understand how to use the application. **The respective documentation can be found in the README.md of the client and server folders. **

## Running npm test on the server

To run the jest tests for the server, navigate into the server folder in terminal and run 'npm tests'.
